# Auth-userTest

This project is a web application built with React that uses Auth0 for authentication. It provides a simple example of how to add authentication to a React application using Auth0's authentication service.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Installing

To install the project dependencies, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

`npm install`

### Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

`npm start`

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Authentication with Auth0

This application uses Auth0 to handle authentication. To set up Auth0 for your own application, you will need to create an account on the Auth0 website and create a new application. Once you have created a new application, you will need to configure the application settings and add the necessary credentials to your React application.

You can find more information about setting up Auth0 for your application in the [Auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/react).

## Deployment

To deploy the application to a production environment, you will need to build the application and deploy the resulting files to a web server. To build the application, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

`npm run build`

This will create a `build` directory containing the compiled application files. You can then deploy these files to a web server of your choice.
